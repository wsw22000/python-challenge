# Python Challenge

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/profit_loss.png)

* Was given a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). 

* Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

![Vote-Counting](Images/voter_buttons_polling_place.png)

* Was tasked with helping a small, theoretical, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

* Was given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset was composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Was required to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* Final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
